# Search-Methods-For-Problem-Solving

## Introduction
In this project, I created a data model for representing the problem of solving a Nonogram and
found heuristic functions to assess the state of the problem. Analyzed the particularities of the various search strategies (A*, Iterative Deepening Search,
Depth First Search, Breadth First Search) and performed a comparative analysis between the properties of the implemented strategies.

The analysis can be found in the [Analysis.pdf](Analysis.pdf) file.

The folder /Teste/ contains all inputs used for testing and analysing the search algorithms.
